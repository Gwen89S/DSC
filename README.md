# Data Science with C# and ML.NET

![Data Science with C# and ML.NET](./assets/DSC.jpg)

This repository contains all course assignments of my Data Science with C# and ML.NET course and will get you up to speed with Microsoft's new ML.NET library.

By working through the code examples, you will build a solid foundation in data science and learn how to design, train, and evaluate complex AI models. I will provide you with all the source code, libraries, and data sets you need to get started.

Please note that this repository only contains code examples with no additional support.
